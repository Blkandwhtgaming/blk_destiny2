Destiny 2 Wishlist
------------------
The wishlists in this repo are used in conjunction with [Destiny Item Manager (DIM)](https://destinyitemmanager.com/). To import these for your use, you can use the links to the raw file data sourced here in github. I update these with only weapons I think are worth going for, not all. I keep this relatively up to date so long as I'm not on a break from the game, which comes from time to time. Choose from one the below:

* dim-wishlist: Collection of recommended rolls by me to the general audience. These are roll combinations from my own personal take as well as some mixed in with popular YouTubers like Aztecross, Datto, Ascendant Nomad, Fallout, SirD and others. Often my opinion as I compare against other weapons, so some may drop off as new, strictly better ones come in, or even have unavailability due to content rotation such as seasons. Keep in minde, "old" weapons may remain so long as you can get lucky with Xur, and they have niche use cases more easily available weapons can not.

* personal-wishlist: My personal wishlist. Has very specfic rolls for chasing for myself. Feel free to to your DIM url list

### More on Wishlists
These lists are updated and can be safely set once to your DIM config.

#### How do I set my wishlists in DIM?
* go to settings in DIM
* Click the wishlist button on the right menu
* Enter the URL in the optional url section. It is pipe delimited, so for example, you could use this URL, which is a combo of my personal-wishlist, blk-wishlist, and the default DIM community wishlist: ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blkandwhtgaming/blk_destiny2/main/dim-personal-wishlist.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources/master/choosy_voltron.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blkandwhtgaming/blk_destiny2/main/dim-wishlist.txt```
