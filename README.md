Destiny 2 Wishlist
------------------
The wishlists in this repo are used in conjunction with [Destiny Item Manager (DIM)](https://destinyitemmanager.com/). To import these for your use, you can use the links to the raw file data sourced here in github. I try to update these within the first week of each new season after reviewing the weapon rolls and stats to determine if they are worth the grind. If you do not see a weapon it is likely outclassed by another in the same archtype and element/kinetic/stasis type. Choose from one the below:

* blk-wishlist: Collection of recommended rolls by me to the general audience. These are roll combinations from my own personal take as well as some mixed in with popular YouTubers like Aztecross, Datto, Ascendant Nomad, Fallout, SirD and others.
  - ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blkandwhtgaming/blk_destiny2/main/dim-wishlist.txt```
* personal-wishlist: My personal wishlist. Has very specfic rolls for chasing for myself, but other if they desire the same. Feel free to to your DIM url list

### More on Wishlists
These lists are updated and can be safely set once to your DIM config.
#### How do I set my wishlists in DIM?
* go to settings in DIM
* Click the wishlist button on the right menu
* Enter the URL in the optional url section. It is pipe delimited, so for example, you could use this URL, which is a combo of my personal-wishlist, blk-wishlist, and the default DIM community wishlist: ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blkandwhtgaming/blk_destiny2/main/dim-personal-wishlist.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources/master/choosy_voltron.txt|https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blkandwhtgaming/blk_destiny2/main/dim-wishlist.txt```
